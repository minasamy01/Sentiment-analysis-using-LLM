            "**Step 1: Deconstruct the text into constituent clauses and identify key entities/aspects.** The text can be broken down into two distinct parts: 'The product is great' (referring to the 'product' aspect) and 'the delivery was slow' (referring to the 'delivery' aspect).",
            "**Step 2: Analyze sentiment and emotional triggers for each clause/aspect.**\n    *   **Clause 1: 'The product is great'**: The emotional trigger 'great' expresses strong satisfaction and approval. This indicates a **Positive** sentiment towards the product itself.\n    *   **Clause 2: 'the delivery was slow'**: The emotional trigger 'slow' implies frustration, inconvenience, or dissatisfaction. This indicates a **Negative** sentiment towards the delivery service.",
            "**Step 3: Identify the conjunction and its role in combining sentiments.** The conjunction 'but' connects these two opposing sentiments. 'But' is an adversative conjunction that introduces a contrasting idea, often highlighting a caveat or a problem that mitigates the preceding positive statement or introduces a significant negative point. In many contexts, the information following 'but' carries significant weight, often representing a key concern or a reason for overall dissatisfaction despite preceding positive remarks.",
            "**Step 4: Synthesize overall sentiment by weighing the opposing sentiments and considering the impact of the negative aspect on the overall experience.** While the product itself receives strong positive feedback, the explicit mention of 'slow' delivery, introduced by 'but', indicates a significant detractor from the overall customer experience. In a customer review or feedback context, a negative service experience (like slow delivery) often impacts overall satisfaction significantly, even if the core product is good. The user felt compelled to highlight a problem, suggesting it's a notable issue affecting their overall perception."
